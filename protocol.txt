Every Packet:
uint32_t packet_length
uint16_t version
uint32_t sequence_number
uint32_t sequence_total
uint16_t function
char* payload

Server Side:

The server is "not smart" it is the clients job to ensure the correct data gets
to the server. When the server receives a packet it will (potentially) change something on
the server and or answer a question.

The server has one internal state values.
1. A working filename it can read or write too.
It is the clients job to understand if that working filename is correct in
general and is correct in specific. The server will report errors and will
(hopefully) not segfault because of bad input but ultimately the client is in
control of what is happening on the server.
